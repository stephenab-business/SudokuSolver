# SudokuSolver
This website was created as a homework for my Design and Analysis of Algorithms class. 

## Purpose
- Gain understanding of website design and understand the algorithm behind Sudoku
- A Sudoku puzzle was to be displayed and the user could try to solve the puzzle
- Every time the user clicked a spot where a number could not be placed, the counter would increment, displaying that they made a mistake

## Results
Works exactly as expected.
